***********************
1 - Download putiotoolbox.safariextz and run it once to add the extension on Safari;

2 - Download putiotbhelper.app and move it to Applications folder;

3 - Install youtube-dl from https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl;

4 - Install airstream from https://github.com/unused/airstream;

Now you will see a new toolbar on Safari with this options:
- Sent to Airplay
- Upload Magnet/Torrent to Put.io
- Search Opensubtitles
- Extract default subtitle from Put.io video
- Show IMDB details
- Search Torrent for this file
- Search trailer


You can use the scripts in two ways:
1- Clicking on the toolbar icons. In this case the script will use Safari’s title or url to perform the selected task
2- Selecting some text on Safari and clicking with the right button will show the context menu with the same toolbar options


On Safari’s preferences is possible to configure some options of putiotoolbox like:
- Default Airplay Device - If none, will show a popup with all devices available
- Put.io Personal Token - You can get this on any Put.io file url or leave blank
- Subtitle Language Code - Ex: pob=portguese brazil or eng=english
- Search Torrent Query URL - Paste here the search url of the torrent site You are using
- Search Trailer Query URL - Paste here the search url of the trailer site You are using

On both Torrent an Trailer Search options you can use the text %%SEARCH_STRING%% to be replaced by the text you selected on Safari.


The option Send to Airplay will work on Put.io and also on Youtube and many other sites supported by youtube-dl.
 

Feel free to change/adapt/copy the scripts or customize the toolbar as you please!!!
